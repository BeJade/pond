Short-term TODOs:

Allow for immediate deletion.
Delete messages while UI is open.
 ? Add delay to server responses.
Compress messages
Yellow indicator for unacked messages.


Minor, non-urgent:

Expose server queue length in fetches

Replying to a message, clicking away from the draft and coming back later
forgets about the reply status.


BUGS:

When revoking, the wrong server is used and revoking a pending contact causes a revocation that can't be sent.
A key exchange should send the group that's currently on the server, not the current group.
